# sketch-number-artboards
Sketch plugin to number selected artboards incrementally

This is in a state where it is below alpha and I don't know if I will increase it beyond that ever!

This is a really quick, first, sketch plugin that I felt would help speed up the process for sequentially naming artboards. I found myself creating a user flow and I would add new artboard in between other which messed up my naming scheme (Ex. 12: home-screen). I created this so I could just select all my artboards and the # would be updated properly while keeping the rest of the name the same.

"Clear" function is primarily just for testing

cmd+ctrl+1 to activate "Number"

Debug with Console.app (built into mac)
