# sketch-number-artboards
Sketch plugin to number selected artboards incrementally

This is a really quick, first, sketch plugin that I felt would help speed up the process for sequentially naming artboards

"Clear" function is primarily just for my use cases

cmd+ctrl+1 to activate "Number"

Debug with Console.app (built into mac)
